Jordi Vitri√† is a Full Professor at the University of Barcelona (UB), which he joined in 2007, and where he teaches an introductory course on **Algorithms for Data Analysis** and advanced courses on **AI Ethics**, **Data Science** and **Deep Learning**. Additionally, he serves as the Director of the [Chair in Artificial Intelligence and Media](https://www.ub.edu/catedres/ca/catedres/catedra-ub-en-intelligencia-artificial-i-mitjans), which is supported by 3Cat.

From April 2011 to January 2016 he served[ as UB'a Head of the Applied Mathematics and Analysis Department. He is now a member of the new Mathematics & Computer Science Department at UB. He is also the director of the [Master in Fundamental Principles of Data Science](https://mat.ub.edu/sciencedata/)) and co-director of the [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](http://www.ub.edu/datascience/postgraduate/) Postgraduate course at UB.

His research, when personal computers had 128KB of memory, was originally oriented towards digital image analysis and how to extract quantitative information from them, but soon evolved towards computer vision problems. After a postdoctoral year at the University of California at Berkeley in 1993, he focused on Bayesian methods for computer vision methods. Now, he is leading a research group working in deep learning, machine learning and causal inference. He has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed papers and holds several international patents. He has directed 15 PhD theses in the area of machine learning and computer vision. He has been the leader of a large number of research projects at international and national level.

He has been always interested in connecting his academic work to the local technological ecosystem, and since 1993 he has been involved in a large number of projects to transfer academic knowledge to industrial production, medical diagnoses and media applications. He is now director of the [DataScience@UB](https://datascience.ub.edu/tecnio/) group technology transfer group that is supported by the Generalitat de Catalunya (TECNIO Center). During the last years the [DataScience@UB](https://datascience.ub.edu/tecnio/) group has been actively collaborating with companies such as Driving01, DegustaBox, Nestle, CorporateHealth, Eurecat, BBVA, IBM, TUV Rheinland, Telefonica, Vodafone, ICGC, Bodas.net, Given Imaging, correYvuela, Ajuntament de Barcelona, 7ideas, etc.

**July 2025**:

I‚Äôm thrilled to announce ‚ÄúHow to Make Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence in Education‚Äù (Octaedro Publishing) (In Catalan and Spanish). This practical guide is designed to help teachers, school leaders, and content creators integrate AI into the classroom in an ethical, safe, and thoughtful way.

üîç What‚Äôs inside?
+ Core principles of predictive and generative AI tailored to educational settings
+ Risks, opportunities, and best practices for protecting students and their privacy
+ A responsible-use checklist and real-world examples from schools already working with AI
+ Strategies to foster critical thinking and digital competence

üìñ The book is available open access to maximize its reach and impact.

üëâ Download it here:

+ Sp√†nish: https://octaedro.com/libro/como-hacer-un-uso-responsable-de-la-inteligencia-artificial-en-educacion/

The key isn‚Äôt to ban AI, but to learn how to use it wisely. I invite the entire education community to read, share, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîdiscuss how we can turn AI into a responsible ally for better learning outcomes.
Special thanks to Octaedro Editorial and everyone who contributed their ideas and experiences during the writing process.
If you read it, I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback!

**May 2025**:

+ R. Pros and J. Vitri√†,["Preventing Spurious Interactions: A New Inductive Bias for Accurate Treatment Effect Estimation,"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016676) in IEEE Access, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3574547.
+ The [UB Chair in Artificial Intelligence and Media](https://www.ub.edu/catedres/ca/catedres/catedra-ub-en-intelligencia-artificial-i-mitjans) publishes the document "**Generation and Dissemination of Synthetic Media in Public Audiovisual Communication**", a proposal of guidelines for the responsible use of artificial intelligence in the audiovisual field. This report, prepared by M√≤nica Navarro-Michel, Oriol Pujol, Carlos Lopezosa, and Jordi Vitri√†, addresses the growing challenges posed by the generation of synthetic images, audio, and video in the context of media and especially in the public sphere. The document offers a set of specific recommendations to ensure transparency, editorial responsibility, and the protection of fundamental rights in the use of these technologies. The proposal is based on a commitment to public service values and includes aspects such as: - The obligation to label synthetic content. - Avoiding risks such as misinformation, manipulation, or privacy violations. - Establishing a responsible AI committee and quality protocols. - Staff training and continuous updating of guidelines. - Promoting a culture of transparency and internal collaboration. This document becomes a key tool for the debate on the future of AI-generated content in public media, in line with the new European Regulation on Artificial Intelligence (RIA).

**January 2025**:

+ [DataScienceUB](https://datascience.ub.edu/research/), in collaboration with [Nextus](https://nextus.global/en), is pleased to announce the launch of an innovative Generative AI project (Nuclis 2024, Generalitat de Catalunya) aimed at revolutionizing the use of multimedia in education. This project focuses on using pre-trained foundational models to significantly improve the ability to analyze and interpret visual content. Large predictive models based on generative AI have notably advanced computer vision, a field that has evolved from simple pattern recognition to sophisticated systems capable of complexly analyzing the visual elements of a video. The project will focus on several key areas to improve educational outcomes:
    +  **Automatic Transcription and Indexing**: By transcribing audio from educational documentaries and indexing the content, educators can easily search and access specific information, making it more convenient to integrate multimedia resources into their teaching.
    +  **Visual Element Detection and Indexing**: The project will detect and index visual elements such as scenes, people, and actions within educational videos. This will enable educators to quickly find relevant visual content to support their lessons.
    + **Clip Selection**: The AI will automatically select short clips from long-duration videos based on predefined themes of interest. This feature will help educators create focused and engaging lesson materials without spending hours sifting through video content.
    + **Description and Summarization**: The selected clips will be described and summarized, providing educators with concise overviews that can be used to introduce topics or reinforce learning objectives.
    + **Support for Educational Material Creation**: The project will assist experts in generating educational materials related to the selected clips. This includes creating quizzes, discussion questions, and supplementary resources that align with the visual content.
